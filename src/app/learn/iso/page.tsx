        <h2 className="text-3xl font-headline mb-4">What is ISO?</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          <b>ISO (International Organization for Standardization)</b> in film photography refers to the <b>film's sensitivity to light</b>. It's a rating that indicates how much light is needed to create a properly exposed image. Common <b>ISO values</b> for film include 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600, and 3200.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Your film camera will have an <b>ISO dial</b>. You must set this dial to match the ISO of the film you have loaded into the camera. This tells the camera's light meter (if it has one) how sensitive the film is, allowing it to suggest correct exposure settings.

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-headline mb-4">Choosing the Right ISO</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The choice of film ISO depends on:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1 mb-4">
          <li><b>Lighting Conditions:</b> Bright light allows for low ISO; dim light often necessitates high ISO.</li>
          <li><b>Desired Grain:</b> If you want minimal grain, choose a low ISO film. If you like a grainy aesthetic or need to shoot in low light, a high ISO film might be appropriate.</li>
          <li><b>Subject Matter:</b> For stationary subjects in good light, low ISO is great. For fast-moving subjects or handheld shooting in low light, high ISO allows for faster shutter speeds to prevent blur.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Unlike digital cameras where you can change ISO for each shot, with film, the <b>ISO is fixed for the entire roll</b>. Choose your film roll wisely based on the conditions you anticipate shooting in.

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-headline mb-4">Pushing and Pulling Film</h2>
        <p>
          <b>"Pushing"</b> film means <b>shooting it at a higher ISO</b> than its box speed (e.g., shooting ISO 400 film at ISO 800 or 1600) and then <b>compensating during development</b>. This <b>increases sensitivity and contrast</b>, often with <b>more grain</b>. <b>"Pulling"</b> is the oppositeâ€”<b>shooting at a lower ISO</b> and <b>under-developing</b>, which <b>reduces contrast and grain</b>. These are <b>advanced techniques</b> that require specific development adjustments.
